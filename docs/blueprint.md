## Original User Request:
I want an application to show where do the holes in a wall when I want to hang frames in the wall. I want to specify the frame dimensions, the shape and the different hangers. Values should be in centimeter and with material design. Mobile responsive, in Inglish. I want to have multiple layout of set of frames (for ex: I want hang 2 frames in vertical, 2 in horizontal or diagonal but I could also want hang 4 frames in different layouts, etc). The app must be free, no IA interfaces or third party tools
